# user-task-frontend

The main purpose of this web application is to provide interface for BPMN **User Tasks** executed on [Python BPMN Engine](https://github.com/ssimic1144/python-bpmn-engine). 

At the current stage this application starts the process on the engine and it assumes that **User Task** follows the **Start Event**. This can be easily modified so that it fits your BPMN model.

Core of this application is `Form.vue` which creates form based on specifications in **User Task**, supported fields can be seen [here](https://github.com/ssimic1144/python-bpmn-engine). Custom form field types are also supported, some of which you can find in `Form.vue`, but if you need more of them, to fulfil your business goals, you will need to extend current *Special cases for controls*.
